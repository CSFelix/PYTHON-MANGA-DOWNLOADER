# 🌟 MANGA DOWNLOADER 🌟

----

### `❓ What's it? ❓`
* Manga Downloader is... (I bet you guess) ... a manga downloader in Python 😯😯.
* This project uses _Manga Panda_ Server to download and you can check website out in this link: http://www.mangapanda.com

----
### `⚒️ Tools ⚒️`
* Google Colab's Account (it's free!)

----
### `⚙️ Run ⚙️`
* Download `manga_panda_downloader.py` file;
* Open Google Colab in: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiW9vG5n_bsAhUAGrkGHe4-DzcQFjAAegQIARAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3A5aPK2kLFzKOzb6sOckVw ;
* Copy and Paste the code;
* Run it!!!

### `📝 Examples 📝`

* You needa tip Anime's name in lowercase only, else, the code will not work.
* At time,s some pages isn't downloaded: It happens because Manga Panda's Server is overloaded.
* Some examples to download (I suggest you read this mangas, they are awesome):

```
boku-no-hero-academia (290 chapters actually, when I did this code)
we-want-to-talk-about-kaguya (103 chapters actually, when I did this code)
noragami (91 chapters actually, when I did this code)
dragon-ball-super (65 chapters actually, when I did this code)
horimiya (120 chapters actually, when I did this code)
```

* Consider I wanna read the  chatper 290 of Boku no Hero Academia (without spoiler, but, this chapter is awesomeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!), I gonna run the code and tip the two inputs like this:

```
boku-no-hero-academia
290
```

* And, _voilá_! The chapter is downloaded in your computer (normally on default download folder  of your browser).
